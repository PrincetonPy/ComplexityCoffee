ComplexityCoffee
================

This is for a hands-on session with the Princeton University Python Community. Perhaps, later, it will be developed into a full analysis of the Complexity Coffee time series.

Thanks to the guys at Warwick Complexity who helped out in collecting the data : Mike Irvine, Sergio Morales, Mike Maitland, Colm Connaughton, Anthony Woolcock, Ben Collyer, Stefano Ugliano, and Arturo Zamorategui.
